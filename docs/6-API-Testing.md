# API Testing

The workflow of GitHub Action is completed.

The way to test your API is as follows:
1. **Follow the example in `tests/unit/app/test_route.py` to create a testing function for your API** (‼️the function name should start with **test**)
2. The testing steps will start after you `push` your change to GitHub, or **create a new pull request**
3. Turn to GitHub, and click **Action** (beside Pull request)
4. Wait to see whether your push or PR succeeds or not
